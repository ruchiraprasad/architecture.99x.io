title: 99x Well Architected Framework
---

## Abstract and Introduction
### Abstract

### Introduction
This is a framework for building market-winning products. This is going to cover 99X architecture process and how the 99X covers the architectural pillars when building a product.

The business architecture is more prominent before code write. Product architecture is more prominent while the product is in development. Infrastructure architecture is more prominent after code freeze until production. Production architecture is more prominent when the Product is in production.

The 99X well architecture framework describes key concepts, design principles, and architectural best practices for designing and developing a product that can run on any platform. By addressing relevant quality attributes, which is specific to each pillars, the stakeholders can clarify almost every gray areas to come up with right architecture style and patterns. 

Further, by answering few fundamental questions lean how to use right architectural style, patterns, and technologies. As well as it will guide to take the right decisions when designing an architecture for a specific requirement.

## Quality Attributes Definitions
  ### Functional Suitability (ISO/ISE 25010, refer)
   (This characteristic represents the degree to which a product or system provides functions that meet stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions)
	
  ### Usability
   (Quality of the userâ€™s experience when interacting with Product)
	
  ### Extensibility | Agility
   (The design needs to be agile enough to incorporate future growth, i.e. Provision for known unknowns)
	
  ### Compatibility (Integrations)
   (Ability to seamlessly integrate with 3rd party systems.)
	
  ### Productization
   (Ability to convert a customer specific to a general product. (white labeling))
	
  ### Performance
   (shows the response of the system to performing certain actions for a certain period)
	
  ### Efficiency
   (It is measured in terms of time required to complete any task given to the system.)
	
  ### Security
   (Security is responsible for the ability of the system to reduce the likelihood of malicious or accidental actions as well as the possibility of theft or loss of information. This can be measure at many levels e.g. Product, Infrastructure.)
	
  ### Privacy
   (Ability of the system to cater to Data Subjects, Controllers and Authorities requirements)
	
  ### Reliability
   (Ability of the system to continue to operate under defined conditions (Resilience, fault tolerance, availability))
	
  ### Functional stability
   (The ability of the system to be able to run smoothly over an extended period of time. Ensure the functionality of the system able to recover in the most efficient way.)
	
  ### Maintainability
   (The level of efficiency at with which a system can be modified)
	
  ### Cost optimization
   (This refers to the optimization of cost at various levels and thereby reducing the Total Cost of Ownership)
	
  ### Governance (regulations related, compliance)
   (The ability of the system to adhere and comply to regulations defined by legal and industry standards)
	
  ### Availability
   (The degree at which the system is able to serve its intended purpose)
	
  ### Observability (Incident response, Monitoring, Testing)
   (Ability to record and log the internal state of the system and infrastructure and respond to incidents in an optimal manner.)
	
  ### Troubleshooting (Supportability?)
   (The ability to respond and resolve incidents in an efficient manner. Ability of the system to provide information helpful for identifying and resolving issues when it fails (1st line of support to hotfix))
